# The goal is automation of a maintenance task on a set of 10 Linux instances (nodes of a database cluster). The maintenance task must:
# 1. run once an hour (overall)  
# 2. run on no more than 1 of the 10 nodes at one time (no overlapping runs) 
# 3. must not run more than one instance of the task on a node, at one time (if the task runs for more than one hour, it cannot start another on the same or other nodes) 
# 4. notify an external system (e.g. slack) about the run, what node it is running on, when that run started and finished 
# 5. log its activity to local syslog - DONE
# 6. send a metric to an external API (e.g. DataDog)
